Charcoal Frontend Development for Grunt
=======================================

> Grunt tasks for developing Charcoal's frontend.

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-charcoal-frontend --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('@locomotivemtl/grunt-charcoal-frontend');
```

or, if you're using [load-grunt-tasks](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks):

```js
require('load-grunt-tasks')(grunt, { scope: 'devDependencies' });
```

## Overview

The Grunt plugin acts, primarily, as a bundle of commonly used grunt tasks for [Charcoal](github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-core).

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
